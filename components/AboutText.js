        I am a 4th year Commerce/Computer Science student at the University of New South Wales
        (UNSW) while also working part time as a HSC Mathematics Tutor and as an IT Administrator at
        a small business.

      <p className='mt-4 text-lg'>
        I have a strong passion for coding and software engineering and love learning new skills!
        Specifically, I thoroughly enjoy working on web development and frontend projects. In my
        free time I enjoy working on new coding projects, doing some video editing, graphic design,
        and gaming!
      </p>
      <p className='mt-4 text-lg'>
        Iâ€™m very detail-orientated, hardworking, and organised. I enjoy working with others and
        taking on new challenges.

      <p className='mt-4 text-lg'>
        I am on track to graduate by the end of 2024 so I am actively seeking 2025 Graduate roles
        and 2024/25 Summer internships for Software Engineering, IT, Commerce, and/or Economics.
